# MultiSpec

Multi-domain specification orchestration for humans and AI agents.

## What is MultiSpec?

MultiSpec bridges the gap between organizational intent (MRD, PRD, UXD) and executable specifications for AI coding agents. It provides a structured workflow for:

- **Domain-specific authoring** - Separate specs for PM, UX, Engineering
- **GTM synthesis** - LLM-generated press releases, FAQs, narratives (Working Backwards)
- **Technical synthesis** - LLM-generated TRD, IRD from source specs
- **Structured evaluation** - Per-domain LLM judges with customizable rubrics
- **Reconciliation** - Conflict detection and tradeoff resolution
- **Target adapters** - Export to SpecKit, GSD, GasTown, GasCity, OpenSpec

## Document Lifecycle

```
HUMAN-AUTHORED (Source)
  MRD.md → PRD.md → UXD.md
           ↓
LLM-GENERATED (GTM) ← Working Backwards
  press.md → faq.md → narrative.md
           ↓
LLM-GENERATED (Technical)
  trd.md → ird.md
           ↓
RECONCILIATION
  All approved specs → spec.md
           ↓
TARGET EXPORT
  spec.md → SpecKit | GSD | GasTown | GasCity | OpenSpec
           ↓
POST-SHIP ALIGNMENT
  spec.md + reality → current-truth.md
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
go install github.com/plexusone/multispec/cmd/multispec@v0.1.0

# Initialize a new project
multispec init user-onboarding

# Validate project structure
multispec lint

# Check project status
multispec status
```

## Key Features

### Readiness Gates

MultiSpec tracks project readiness through configurable gates:

| Gate | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Required specs present | All required source specs exist |
| Evaluations passing | No blocking evaluation findings |
| Approvals obtained | All required specs have approvals |
| Execution spec generated | `spec.md` has been created |

### Multiple Output Formats

Status reports can be generated in multiple formats for different use cases:

- **Text** - Terminal output with icons
- **JSON** - Programmatic access
- **HTML** - Browser-viewable reports with traffic light indicators
- **Markdown** - For embedding in documentation

### MCP Integration

MultiSpec includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for integration with AI coding assistants like Claude Code and Kiro CLI.
